**Breaking News: The lockdown affected men and women equally. At home, it additionally constrained them to share family tasks. This emergency will have long term outcomes on gender roles and stereotypes in the nation.**



**Reality Check: The lockdown affected men and women equally. But unfortunately, this crisis will not have long-lasting consequences on gender roles and stereotypes in the country. The hope is too good to be true!**



The COVID-19 pandemic speaks to an enormous global health crisis. By now, it has become clear that this pandemic is not only a global health emergency, but is also leading to an unprecedented global economic downturn. All of us are suffering together. We are wedged in the same catastrophe and are burdened equally. But, are we really?



As daily life grinds to a halt worldwide and as the recommendations of epidemiologists and public health experts are being put to test, men and women are adjusting to this new reality of remote working. The pandemic has wreaked havoc worldwide and India continues to be in the line of fire. While cases continued to rise, India also experienced a crisis of another kind, that of the effect of lockdown on the women of the country. Although men were also dealing with the impacts of this situation, it was traditionally women who were carrying the heaviest load.



While both men and women were stranded at home, who of the two was managing the torrential slide of domestic chores and care work lopsidedly? On a fundamental level, it was women, regardless of the fact if they were holding a job or not. On the off chance, if they did, in that case the twofold weight of domestic errands and their job along with the lack of house help during lockdown made it even more tiresome and hectic for her.

As the pandemic went on to become bigger, the gender division of the household with an underlying patriarchal tone, unspoken sexism and complete disregard of unpaid care work, became more prevalent than ever.



According to the World Economic Forum’s Global Gender Gap Index 2020, India ranks poorly at 112 out of 153 countries when it comes to women’s disadvantage compared to men in health, education, economy and politics. According to report by Oxfam India, women are judged by the quality of their housework, and this is also a “trigger for violence on women”.

The most horrific and obvious impact of the lockdown imposed to flatten the curve, but it was also a rise in domestic and intimate partner violence of which the accounts are painful to even read. Ladies were being battered by baffled and frustrated partners and in some adverse cases were being kicked out of the house if they fell sick. With schools and work environments shut, women and girls in oppressive circumstances had no rest. As social distancing forces both men and women to stay indoors, the home had become the most contested space for equal gender relations. “Even in very enlightened households, women have been doing most of the domestic work, especially tasks that are repetitive, backbreaking and time-consuming.” says Ranu Bhogal, director-policy, Oxfam India.



Many experts are of the opinion that multiple social movements, studies, media have led men, in India and all over the world, to become more open to embracing the idea of gender equality and identity. However, to bridge this gap on the domestic front, one needs to start a dialogue on equality; and the pandemic could be that opportunity.



The pandemic has become a setback to those women who have been fighting cultural and societal biases. It has led to increase the burden of unpaid work on women and girls, increased risk of gender-biased violence, impacted women’s economic empowerment, impacted women migrant workers, and interrupted access to sexual and reproductive health to say the least. One cannot help but wonder the surmounting amount of psychological and mental stress all this brought along.



The pandemic has brought forth the glaring inequalities among men and women in the society and shown that it continues to impact women in myriad ways; and the only way that stereotypes could be broken and gender roles be redefined, is when a dialogue is started in each household. Through the corridors of time, humanity has made efforts to bridge the gender gap. We cannot allow this pandemic to reverse advances and further deepen the gender gap.
