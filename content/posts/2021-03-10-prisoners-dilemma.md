excerpt: OPEC is an inter-governmental organisation comprising of 13 heavily
  oil-producing countries. The basis of OPEC is that these countries jointly
  limit oil supply at any given time. Reduced supply of oil increases prices,
  which increases profitability of oil producing countries. If all countries
  agree to increase its price OPEC will face its strategically optimal outcome
  of high profitability.

*Hey Alexa!*

*What will we be learning today?*

**It is the Prisoner's Dilemma**

The prisoner's dilemma is a paradox in decision analysis wherein if two individuals act in their self-interests, then they do not produce the optimal outcome. The typical prisoner's dilemma is set up in such a way that both parties choose to protect themselves at the expense of the other participant. As a result, both participants find themselves in a worse state than they could have been in had they cooperated in the decision-making process.

*It seems to be very complicated, google give me an example of it.*

Let us take an example to understand the concept of the prisoner's dilemma efficiently and effectively. The example contains two men namely, Harris and Monty. One day, the police arrested Harris for selling drugs and on the same evening, they caught Monty selling drugs. They were brought to the police station and were told that this is an open and shut case. Both were informed individually that they were convicted for drug dealing and they would be jailed for two years. The example assumes two years of jail and nothing else for drug dealing. But while talking to them, the police suddenly realized out of some suspicion that these two were involved in a much more serious offense i.e., of an armed robbery that happened some weeks ago. But the problem was that the police had no hard evidence, as it was just a suspicion. The force tried to get a deal with each of them so that they have an incentive to snitch on each other. What they informed each of the dealers is that they will be punished for two years if they are arrested under the drug-dealing case. That’s the kind of guarantee. But the police gave them other options as follows-:

* If Harris confesses that he and Monty were involved in the armed robbery and Monty denies that fact, then Harris will be punished for 1 year and Monty will be punished for 7 years. This simply means that Harris's time will be reduced to 1 year from 2 years and Monty will spend a lot more time in jail. This is the direct benefit for Harris.
* If Harris denies that he and Monty were involved in the armed robbery and Monty confesses that fact, then Harris will be punished for 7 years and Monty will be punished for 1 year. This simply means that Monty’s time will be reduced to 1 year from 2 years and Harris will spend a lot more time in jail. There is a direct benefit for Monty.
* If Harris and Monty both confess, then they both will be jailed for 3 years.
* Also as told earlier if both deny the fact of armed robbery then both will be jailed for 2 years under a drug-dealing case.

So, the above scenario is called the prisoner's dilemma because we will see as we further dig that both Harris and Monty have a globally optimal scenario where they both can deny the fact of armed robbery and can take the punishment of 2 years in jail. But we will see based on their incentives assuming that they both do not have loyalties towards each other, they are hardened criminals, they do not bother about each other in any way, hence they would rationally pick non-optimal scenario for themselves. That is instead of both denying the fact of armed robbery, they both will confess.

**Let us see Harris's point of view**, he is unaware whether Monty will confess or deny. Let us assume Monty confesses, if now Harris confesses, he will get 3 years of jail but if he denies then he will get 7 years of jail. So, Harris should confess. But Harris doesn’t exactly know what Monty would be doing, he might deny. So, now let us assume Monty denies, if now Harris denies, he will get 2 years of jail but if he confesses then he will get 1 year of jail. Well, once again Harris should confess. So, regardless of Monty confessing or denying, the optimal choice for Harris is to confess. **Similarly, from Monty’s point of view confessing will always be a better option**.

The above confession is called a **Nash Equilibrium**. The Nash equilibrium is a concept of game theory where the optimal outcome of a game is one where no player has an incentive to deviate from his/her chosen strategy after considering an opponent's choice. Game theory is a theoretical framework to conceive social situations among competing players and produce optimal decision-making of independent and competing actors in a strategic setting.

Both Harris and Monty are choosing Nash Equilibrium state as opposed to globally optimal scenario i.e., they both are choosing to confess and are ready to take the punishment of 3 years rather than both denying the fact of armed robbery and getting the punishment of 2 years.

***Isn't the concept of the prisoner's dilemma interesting?*** That is why it is said in game theories that *“blame the game, not the players”* because nothing is in the player’s hand, the result is always of cooperation between the players.
