excerpt: OPEC is an inter-governmental organisation comprising of 13 heavily
  oil-producing countries. The basis of OPEC is that these countries jointly
  limit oil supply at any given time. Reduced supply of oil increases prices,
  which increases profitability of oil producing countries. If all countries
  agree to increase its price OPEC will face its strategically optimal outcome
  of high profitability.

**OPEC** is an inter-governmental organisation comprising of 13 heavily oil-producing countries. The basis of OPEC is that these countries jointly limit oil supply at any given time. Reduced supply of oil increases prices, which increases profitability of oil producing countries. If all countries agree to increase its price OPEC will face its strategically optimal outcome of high profitability.

However, some nations may take advantage of the limits. If prices are high, a nation may overproduce to reap more profits.

Thus, each  country may choose to slightly overproduce. This is their nash equilibrium, because if each other countries is overproducing no country will desire to abide by the limits. This nash equilibrium causes overproduction of oil and lowers prices. 

OPEC was created in order to avoid this prisonerâ€™s dilemma and regulate production of oil. However, since this nash equilibrium lies in bypassing regulations, this is still unreliable. Bypassing the limits is one of that factors that contributed to oil overproduction in 2020.
