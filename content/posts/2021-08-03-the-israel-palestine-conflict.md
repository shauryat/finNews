excerpt: The Israel Palestine conflict can be traced up to 100 years back. After
  the Ottoman Empire, which ruled that part of the Middle East, was defeated in
  WW-I, Britain took control of Palestine, where a Jewish minority and an Arab
  majority lived. When the international community gave Britain a task of
  building a "national home" for the Jewish people in Palestine, tensions
  between the two communities grew. It was their ancestral home for Jews, but
  Palestinian Arabs also claimed the country and opposed it. The number of Jews
  arriving in the United States increased between the 1920s

The Israel Palestine conflict can be traced up to 100 years back. After the Ottoman Empire, which ruled that part of the Middle East, was defeated in WW-I, Britain took control of Palestine, where a Jewish minority and an Arab majority lived. When the international community gave Britain a task of building a "national home" for the Jewish people in Palestine, tensions between the two communities grew. It was their ancestral home for Jews, but Palestinian Arabs also claimed the country and opposed it. The number of Jews arriving in the United States increased between the 1920s and the 1940s, with many fleeing persecutions in Europe and finding a homeland following WW-II's Holocaust. Violence between Jews and Arabs, as well as resistance to British rule, increased. The United Nations voted in 1947 to divide Palestine into separate Jewish and Arab states, with Jerusalem designated as an international city. This proposal was approved by Jewish leaders, but was rejected by Arab leaders and thus never put into action.

Britain withdrew from Palestine in May 1948, less than a year after the Partition Plan for Palestine was implemented, and Israel declared itself an independent state, suggesting willingness to carry out the Partition Plan. Nearly immediately, neighbouring Arab armies moved in to prevent the Israeli state from forming. The Arab Israeli War of 1948 was fought between Israel and five Arab countries: Jordan, Iraq, Syria, Egypt, and Lebanon. Israel occupied more than two-thirds of the former British Mandate by the end of the war in July 1949, while Jordan took control of the West Bank, Egypt, and the Gaza Strip. Post this a six-day war in 1967 took place, where, Israel had taken possession of the Gaza Strip, the West Bank, the Sinai Peninsula (a desert area between the Mediterranean and the Red Sea) and the Golan Heights by the end of the war (a rocky plateau located between Syria and modern-day Israel). ("Palestine")

Over the next few decades, the aftermath of the 1967 Arab Israeli War would result in continuing instability and armed conflict between Israel and its neighbours even after the infamous Oslo Accords coming into place.

**Current situation**

Tensions between Israel and Palestinians in East Jerusalem, Gaza, and the West Bank are frequently heavy. Gaza is ruled by Hamas, a Palestinian militant group that has fought Israel numerous times. Israel and Egypt maintain tight control over Gaza's borders in order to prevent arms from reaching Hamas. Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank claim that Israeli acts and restrictions are causing them pain. While Israel claims that it only acts in self-defence against Palestinian aggression. After the start of the holy Muslim month of Ramadan in mid-April 2021, things have gotten worse, with nightly clashes between police and Palestinians. The threat of eviction for some Palestinian families in East Jerusalem has sparked more outrage. Many powerful countries like the United States have supported the Israeli government and ignored the Palestinian cause. At the same time there have been huge number of protests in many countries advocating for the human rights of Palestinian citizens. A series of controversial Israeli actions in Jerusalem — including the attempted eviction of Palestinian families in East Jerusalem by right-wing Jewish settlers, an Israeli police raid on Palestinian worshippers at al-Aqsa Mosque, and a planned provocative march by far-right Israelis — prompted Hamas to fire a barrage of rockets at Jerusalem and other Israeli targets. Israel retaliated with destructive airstrikes in the Gaza Strip, which is run by Hamas. For days, both sides have traded blows, resulting in hundreds of deaths and widespread collateral damage, mainly but not exclusively on the Palestinian side, as well as the Israeli strike that destroyed Al Jazeera and the Associated Press offices in Gaza.

**Major problems:**

There are many topics on which Israelis and the Palestinians are at odds. These include questions such as what should happen to Palestinian refugees, whether Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank should remain or be withdrawn, whether the two sides should share Jerusalem, and, perhaps most importantly, whether a Palestinian state should be established alongside Israel. Peace negotiations have been held on and off for more than 25 years, but the dispute is yet to be resolved.

**Proposed solutions:**

* Accept that their existing solutions are ineffective and that they are harming themselves along with the other party. Before taking any new initiatives, the bigger picture must be considered.
* Reduce the other side's challenges and be willing to take chances for peace.
* Reaffirm the goal of peaceful coexistence, stating that both sides have the right to live in viable states in former Palestine—and that both sides lament the loss of the hope of reclaiming the entire territory.
* Expect the international community to keep both sides accountable for their actions and to abandon any preference for one over the other.
