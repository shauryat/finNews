Venezuela, a South American nation, is often associated with political and economic decline. But not many know that this country is home for the largest reserves of bauxite, gold, coal, iron ore and oil. It sits on 14.3 trillion dollars’ worth of natural resources and the largest oil reserves known to humankind, eclipsing most of the other OPEC producers’ potentials. Despite a general abundance of natural resources, it suffers from devastating international sanctions and has the highest recorded inflation rate. The country’s situation is a perfect ground for revealing how mismanagement of national resources and inadequate economic policies could lead to precarious situations.

The crisis primarily revolves around oil and helps reveal various socio-economic problems like, political corruption, chronic shortages of food and medicine, closure of companies, unemployment, deterioration of productivity, authoritarianism, human rights violations, gross economic mismanagement and high dependence on oil; all serve as a learning ground for potential economists and firms to prevent impending catastrophe and also provide much needed aid to Venezuela, the country which went from riches to rags.



Venezuela used to be the richest country in South America in the 1980s, but soon descended into chaos. In 1976, President Carlos Perez nationalized the oil industry under the public company PDVSA. However, with the beginning of the Bolivarian social revolution in the late 1990s, Venezuela sought to heavily alleviate poverty and redistribute its newfound wealth. Stepping into the 2000s, the prices of oil soared drastically, going from $9 to $100 per barrel. Venezuelan PDVSA jumped on this chance to capitalise on the new profits and, succeeded returning with more profits than earlier. The problem began when these profits were reinvested into government handouts instead of a sovereign wealth fund which would have provided a long-term source of income or better infrastructure for production boost. Despite its abundance of oil, the country continued operation on limited yields, worsened by the OPEC monopoly which again limited the oil production.

Analysing the consequences, the country ended up becoming increasingly dependent on short term profits which is a macroeconomic blunder. The oil prices dipped, and the country’s lack of investment in infrastructure resulted in collapse of other industries, a phenomenon called Dutch Disease. Dutch disease is a fascinating phenomenon seen across ages and is central to understanding the context of Venezuela. It refers to the juxtaposition where the development of one sector of the economy, here oil production in Venezuela, leads to the decline of other sectors as the entire economy seeks to revolve around a singular sector of activity, a common blunder, since diversification and multifarious reliance is the building fundamentality of economics.

The primary causes for the Venezuelan financial crisis are again a prime example of a quixotic economic approach. Rise in oil prices to $100 per barrel in 2004 filled the coffers of the Venezuelan Government and PDVSA. But the government played its pieces wrong, for the Bolivarian Social Revolution Policies which involved overspending and lowering taxes, intensively. This returned as the unfinished sequel when oil prices tanked and the nation was left with unusable wealth and negligible revenue. Furthermore, there was overdependence on oil as the currency value rose and other industries could no longer compete in markets due to cheaper imported alternatives, catalysing decline. Venezuelan government nationalised such companies and operated them at a loss to prevent an economic crisis, which happened nevertheless.

The repercussions of this financial catastrophe created ripples, transforming the nation forever. Venezuela entered a period of hyperinflation, which reached 1.35 million percent in 2018. Rampant overprinting of currency failed as a policy. There were reeling images of lack of access to food, medical supplies, clean water, electricity and other basic necessities which eventually led to many deaths. Living standards dipped and grains were in grave shortage. The most mineral rich country on the planet turned into a geopolitical vacuum. As unemployment rate reached a record high of 45%, looting and lawlessness became commonplace.

Venezuela reported 62,000 confirmed cases, however claimed by official statistics as underreporting due to limited testing. The pandemic has driven trade and food production down, while strict curfews and fuel shortages have prevented Venezuelans from leaving their homes to purchase supplies, leading to food insecurity for 32% of the people.

The Venezuelan economy contracted by about 26 per cent in 2020. International remittances, being one of the sole lifeboats, are expected to diminish by 50 per cent, as increasingly vulnerable Venezuelan migrants lose their jobs in other countries while some financial institutions become increasingly intolerant in conducting business inside the domestic territory of Venezuela.

Presently, Venezuela stands in jeopardy. The opposition plan calls for a “deep restructuring” of external public debt to “open fiscal space to guarantee a sustainable path for public finances.” Fuelled by economic mismanagement and political allegiances, Venezuela stands as an archetype of financial crises in the modern world. As the country barrels down a tunnel of uncertainty and social mishaps, the potentiality of a brighter future remains in a mist crying for desperate action. At the end of the day, economies are built on people, on public welfare. In the absence of it, economic welfare stands on faithless grounds, as is the current situation in Venezuela.
