excerpt: OPEC is an inter-governmental organisation comprising of 13 heavily
  oil-producing countries. The basis of OPEC is that these countries jointly
  limit oil supply at any given time. Reduced supply of oil increases prices,
  which increases profitability of oil producing countries. If all countries
  agree to increase its price OPEC will face its strategically optimal outcome
  of high profitability.

A highly bullish equity market in the past year has led to an unprecedented boom in Initial Public Offerings (IPO). Led by companies such as Airbnb Inc., Snowflake Inc., and Doordash Inc., fresh IPOs raised a record-breaking US$83 billion in 2020. On their first day of trading Doordash’s shares closed at 85% above their IPO listings and Airbnb and Snowflake over a 100% above theirs'. Brazil’s IPO market closely followed suit with its biggest year in a decade, while South Korea - with the market debut of Big Hit Entertainment, the agency behind BTS - listed its largest IPO in three years.

2020s IPO successes can largely be attributed to the year’s soaring equity market. After the sharp dip in March, global market indices have seen significant growth. The MSCI world, a weighted stock index of large and mid-cap equities in developed markets, closed 61% above the year’s market bottom, while multiple other indices touched on 70%. Investing in the equity market in 2020 was highly lucrative, particularly in the technology and healthcare sectors.

Another vital factor to the IPO successes was the overwhelmingly low interest rates and bond yields. Due to falling demand, Central Banks reduced interest rates across the board. For many investors this resulted in a high quantity of cash with nowhere to invest it, as keeping the cash in savings accounts and treasury bonds would depreciate its value. Consequently, the soaring equity market, and headlining IPOs, appealed to investors across the world. Investors chose to invest their money in these newly public companies with the hope that they will yield higher returns in the future, helping to face any inflation that may follow the pandemic.

However, it remains uncertain whether the success of these new listings is sustainable or not. Doordash’s market debut moved its market capitalisation to four times its last private valuation. Despite this the firm barely remains profitable, only earning its first positive quarter in Q3 2020. Even this success was assisted by the pandemic, which saw consumers ordering more deliveries and dining out less frequently - as such, whether Doordash maintains profitability in a post-pandemic era remains to be seen. Importantly, Doordash was not an exception. Big Hit Entertainment’s share price catapulted to over 60 times their projected earnings for 2021. Historically, such high valuations have not been maintained in the long-term, although the market continues to bring us surprises.

The near-term aftermath of this booming IPO market remains uncertain. The last time companies raised this volume of capital through stock market listings was in 2007. As we know, this was immediately followed by the Great Recession, a major global financial crisis, that was felt around the world through both a major market crash and skyrocketing unemployment. Of course, IPO listings cannot be viewed as a cause for recession, however, some patterns can be observed.

A large number of companies said to be overvalued, with market prices not reflective of the solidity of their fundamentals, is representative of a bubble. A parallel can be made to the dotcom bubble of the late 1990s. The increasing prominence of the internet led people to invest in startups, which increased share prices, thus encouraging more investment and creating a cycle leading to massive overvaluations. Many startups did not adopt viable business models, have cash reserves, or show strong company fundamentals - investment was largely driven by speculation. This is true for a significant portion of listings in 2020 as well. Back to the dotcom era, the bursting of the bubble led to market panic and massive sell-offs. When the dust settled, investors were estimated to have lost around $5 trillion.

However, it is not necessary that this IPO/equity price boom is a bubble, or that it will burst. In many ways, 2020 is entirely different. For one, increasing share prices are not concentrated around one sector - technology, consumer goods and healthcare have each seen major success. Furthermore, investor decisions seem to be based around long-term sustainability. Sustainable energy, the semiconductor industry, CRISPR technology, and electric vehicles are all investments that will continue to increase in relevance in the coming years. This is particularly true for consumer tech, as well as SaaS companies like Snowflake. Unlike the 1990s, 2020 is characterised by a major event that will likely shift consumer behaviour. COVID-19 may increase the relevance, and necessity, of such technology permanently, allowing sustainable, long-term growth in the sector.

The 2020 IPO boom was largely unexpected. In many ways, the high value of IPOs and their soaring market debuts are reflective of an equity market that is disconnected from the economic and social realities of COVID-19. However, the investments of 2020 may be representative of a long-term shift in consumer sentiment. It represents an increasing gravitation towards the tech sector, and this time, the remote work capabilities and accelerated digitisation may cause a permanent shift in consumer behaviour. The larger trading volume in 2020 may indicate that new players are coming into the stock market, perhaps guided by the low interest rates, which may affect prices in the near future. At the same time, recent IPO successes could encourage more private companies to go public to gain capital. This may create more competitive markets and technologies in the coming years. The path that investors will take post-COVID, and which consequences’ path yields, remains to be seen. However, it is incontestable that the past year has and will cause major shifts in both company market listings and consumer behaviour.
